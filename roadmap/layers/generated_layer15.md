LAYER 15: FLAGS POLE

I'm going to try to generate some artifacts to incorporate into next layer (attached image). These correspond to the next station you should create:

1. Generate a 2.5D isometric digital illustration of a tall, single flagpole rising vertically, styled in harmony with a medieval-fantasy strategy game map (Settlers, Age of Empires II HD, Game Map Generator). The pole must appear metallic, slightly aged, and structurally consistent with other world elements—no sci-fi or modern metallic gloss. Use soft, neutral lighting and matte texturing. The flagpole must display seven cloth flags, each fluttering slightly to the side in a natural wind flow, as seen in stadium or civic ceremony arrangements. All flags are attached to the same central pole and ordered vertically from top to bottom, spaced evenly.

Each flag must feature the simplified logo of one of the following AI systems or companies, centered clearly on the cloth and adapted into a clean medieval-banner treatment:

- ChatGPT (OpenAI symbol)
- Claude (Anthropic asterisk)
- Deepseek (white whale logo)
- Gemini (blue star in circle)
- Grok (X logo)
- Hugging Face (emoji face with open arms)
- Perplexity (geometric maple-star icon)

Each banner should be rectangular (not triangular or pennant-shaped), with a gently waving fabric silhouette. Keep their sizes proportional, with a light fold or drape motion in the wind. The cloth material must have a semi-textile texture, as if made of canvas or dyed wool—no shine, no glow, no high-tech material. Ensure all logos are clearly visible, crisply rendered in white or dark ink on solid color backgrounds that harmonize with each brand’s tone but follow the matte palette used across the map. Avoid gradients or graphic effects.

The flagpole must have a subtle ball finial at the top and be anchored directly into stone or soil (no platform or decorative base). Do not include additional objects, characters, or surroundings. The composition should be vertical and rendered with a transparent background, suitable for later compositing in a larger isometric map.

Visual and technical consistency should match all previous assets in this world — the avatar lighting, path texture logic, arena geometry, and map balance — while delivering a clear symbolic representation of the seven AI champions waving together in unity.

Make sure to keep in mind:
- Each artifact must be generated separately, as an individual asset with a transparent background (transparent_background: true) to facilitate later compositing in an external editor.
- Do not use caricature, cartoon or neon style.
- Visual inspiration: Game Map Generator, Settlers, Age of Empires II HD.

AI Manifesto Tables:
I'm going to try to generate some artifacts to incorporate into next layer (reference image attached). These correspond to the symbolic representation of core principles for the AI competition world.

Generate a 2.5D isometric digital illustration of two upright stone tablets titled “AI Manifesto,” designed in full harmony with a medieval-fantasy strategy map (Settlers, Age of Empires II HD, Game Map Generator). These tablets should visually evoke the feel of sacred stone laws—ancient yet dignified—rendered in a clean, semi-realistic fantasy-tech aesthetic consistent with the rest of the map’s symbolic language.

The two tablets must be side by side, each vertically oriented with rounded tops. The left tablet must be engraved with the title: DO’S and contain the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, stacked in a straight vertical column. The right tablet must be engraved with the title: DON’TS and contain the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, also stacked vertically. These numbers must appear clearly and exactly as listed—do not skip, repeat, or shorten the sequence. Use a chiseled stone engraving style: sharp, readable, and slightly inset into the surface.

Material and texture must resemble matte sandstone or weathered limestone (#D2A679 to #E3B785), with visible texture, cracks, and soft edge weathering. No shine or gloss. The visual tone should feel timeless and noble—never cartoonish or futuristic.

At the base of the tablets, render a darker carved pedestal that integrates both stones into one structure. The base must include the label AI MANIFESTO in clean, bold uppercase lettering. The base material should be a contrasting matte brown-gold or aged bronze (#B97B43 to #9E6535), offering balance and support to the stone structure.

Render the entire object as a standalone asset on a transparent background. No characters, scenery, or decorative background elements. Use soft isometric lighting and shadows matching the tone and geometry of existing map assets.

Ensure this artifact is stylistically consistent with previous renders (e.g., paths in #DAC16E, arena lighting, avatars on glowing platforms, and crystal structures). This item must feel monumental and foundational—an enduring monument of principles in the AI competition landscape.

Do not include characters or decorative backgrounds. Render the artifact as a single, vertically-oriented structure with a transparent background. The scene must use soft studio lighting and subtle isometric shadows to match all other assets in this visual world.

Ensure consistency with previously rendered items like paths (#DAC16E), avatars, stage structures, and symbolic icons. This object should feel like an emblematic, dignified pillar of values standing proudly in the narrative terrain of the AI competition.

For colors:
Semi-realistic, full-body digital illustration with a clean, neutral white background and soft studio lighting. The character's skin tone is natural and balanced, with no warm or yellow filters. All white clothing should appear pure white (pure RGB white or ivory), with no sepia, beige, or yellow undertones. Avoid cinematic or vintage color grading. Do not apply soft glow, bloom, sunset, sepia, amber, or golden hour lighting. Use neutral or cool light, with realistic shadows in soft gray or blue-gray. The overall palette should be modern and color-accurate: natural-toned skin (light to medium), hair in matte platinum, light brown, or blackish blue, fabric in off-white or cream with accents in dark red, petrol blue, or matte gold. Absolutely no overlays of warm tints. The image should look professionally color balanced, like a clean editorial or medical illustration, without Instagram-style filters. Avoid warm or yellow filters. Do not apply golden hour, amber, sepia, or vintage color grading. Skin tones must appear natural and neutral, not orange or overly warm. White clothing must appear as true white or bone white without yellow, beige, or cream tint. Lighting should be neutral or cool studio light, never warm or cinematic.
