LAYER 5: CRYSTAL PALACE OF DELIBERATION

I'm going to try to generate some artifacts to incorporate into next layer (attached image). These correspond to the next station you should create:

1. Crystal Palace of Deliberation: a 2.5D isometric digital illustration of a majestic crystal palace, styled as a semi-medieval glass dome pavilion. The architecture should resemble a fantasy-style observatory or greenhouse, with white stone base, clear glass panels, and a tall, curved glass dome. Inside the transparent dome, render visible a group of people seated at a circular table in deliberation, symbolizing a council selecting finalists based on merit. Above the dome, placed at the pinnacle, render a glowing, symmetrical scale of justice (a balance) in white stone.


Make sure to keep in mind:
- Each artifact must be generated separately, as an individual asset with a transparent background (transparent_background: true) to facilitate later compositing in an external editor.
- Paths are delimited with black color and inside that area you must fill with sand color.
- Render all path segments explicitly. In the reference sketch, there are two black-outlined walking paths on the right side of the Crystal Palace. These black outlines represent the exact shape and placement of the roads. You must render both of them, exactly as defined. Do not ignore, skip, or simplify any. Each of these paths must be completely filled with solid color #DAC16E, and the fill must reach edge-to-edge between the black lines, forming a smooth, matte surface with no gradients or texture. The final render must not include the black lines—use them only to define the road's shape. These paths are not optional or decorative—they are required structural elements that must appear precisely in the final image.
- Do not use caricature, cartoon or neon style.
- Visual inspiration: Game Map Generator, Settlers, Age of Empires II HD.

Text-free:
Ignore any visible text in the reference image. You should not include words or labels such as 'QUINIANO' or 'MAGNUS' in the final rendering.

For colors:
Semi-realistic, full-body digital illustration with a clean, neutral white background and soft studio lighting. The character's skin tone is natural and balanced, with no warm or yellow filters. All white clothing should appear pure white (pure RGB white or ivory), with no sepia, beige, or yellow undertones. Avoid cinematic or vintage color grading. Do not apply soft glow, bloom, sunset, sepia, amber, or golden hour lighting. Use neutral or cool light, with realistic shadows in soft gray or blue-gray. The overall palette should be modern and color-accurate: natural-toned skin (light to medium), hair in matte platinum, light brown, or blackish blue, fabric in off-white or cream with accents in dark red, petrol blue, or matte gold. Absolutely no overlays of warm tints. The image should look professionally color balanced, like a clean editorial or medical illustration, without Instagram-style filters. Avoid warm or yellow filters. Do not apply golden hour, amber, sepia, or vintage color grading. Skin tones must appear natural and neutral, not orange or overly warm. White clothing must appear as true white or bone white without yellow, beige, or cream tint. Lighting should be neutral or cool studio light, never warm or cinematic.
