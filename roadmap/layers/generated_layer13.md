LAYER 13: ELEANOR ROOSEVELT

I'm going to try to generate some artifacts to incorporate into next layer (attached image). These correspond to the next station you should create:

1. Generate a 2.5D isometric digital illustration of a character inspired by Eleanor Roosevelt, designed to match the visual style of the avatars Quiliano, Magnus, and Ada from a medieval-fantasy strategy map (Settlers, Age of Empires II HD, Game Map Generator). The character should be standing on a round, glowing water platform in soft blue tones (#92D6F0 to #B5E8FF), matching the base structure of other avatars — but the figure itself must be fully colored in natural tones (not holographic or blue-tinted).

The character is a young Eleanor, wearing the sky-blue dress from the reference photo with embroidered details. Her skin tone, facial features, and soft brown hair must appear natural and color-accurate. She is gently smiling and speaking to an audience, slightly leaning forward in a relaxed, expressive pose. One hand is holding a small vintage-style microphone (brushed metal with black grille), while the other is gesturing mid-sentence, conveying warmth and confidence.

In front of her, include a clean and elegant modern metallic lectern: a thin pedestal-style stand with a narrow angled top, rendered in brushed steel or pewter tones. The lectern must not look sci-fi or glossy — keep it grounded and semi-realistic in tone, blending with the visual world of the map.

Ship Design:
The ship must have a semi-rounded bow, wooden hull, and minimal ornamentation. Render 2–3 cabin windows, a raised deck area, and one or two sails that appear tied or partially folded (not deployed). The sail fabric should be in neutral or weathered tones (beige, ivory, or light gray) with no modern materials. Wood texture must be matte and slightly weathered — no gloss or shine. Render from a top-down isometric perspective, consistent with the rest of the map.

Style and Integration:
Use soft isometric shadows and neutral lighting. The boat and dock must be presented as a standalone asset with a transparent background, ready to be placed over a pre-rendered ocean. Do not render water, waves, or sea foam. Avoid cartoon outlines or sci-fi elements — keep the aesthetic medieval-fantasy and consistent with structures like stone towers, domes, and paths from previous map layers.

Make sure to keep in mind:
- Each artifact must be generated separately, as an individual asset with a transparent background (transparent_background: true) to facilitate later compositing in an external editor.
- Paths are delimited with black color and inside that area you must fill with sand color.
- Render all path segments explicitly. In the reference sketch, there are two black-outlined walking paths on the right side of the Crystal Palace. These black outlines represent the exact shape and placement of the roads. You must render both of them, exactly as defined. Do not ignore, skip, or simplify any. Each of these paths must be completely filled with solid color #DAC16E, and the fill must reach edge-to-edge between the black lines, forming a smooth, matte surface with no gradients or texture. The final render must not include the black lines—use them only to define the road's shape. These paths are not optional or decorative—they are required structural elements that must appear precisely in the final image.
- Do not use caricature, cartoon or neon style.
- Visual inspiration: Game Map Generator, Settlers, Age of Empires II HD.

Text-free:
Ignore any visible text in the reference image. You should not include words or labels such as 'AI' or 'ADA' in the final rendering.

For colors:
Semi-realistic, full-body digital illustration with a clean, neutral white background and soft studio lighting. The character's skin tone is natural and balanced, with no warm or yellow filters. All white clothing should appear pure white (pure RGB white or ivory), with no sepia, beige, or yellow undertones. Avoid cinematic or vintage color grading. Do not apply soft glow, bloom, sunset, sepia, amber, or golden hour lighting. Use neutral or cool light, with realistic shadows in soft gray or blue-gray. The overall palette should be modern and color-accurate: natural-toned skin (light to medium), hair in matte platinum, light brown, or blackish blue, fabric in off-white or cream with accents in dark red, petrol blue, or matte gold. Absolutely no overlays of warm tints. The image should look professionally color balanced, like a clean editorial or medical illustration, without Instagram-style filters. Avoid warm or yellow filters. Do not apply golden hour, amber, sepia, or vintage color grading. Skin tones must appear natural and neutral, not orange or overly warm. White clothing must appear as true white or bone white without yellow, beige, or cream tint. Lighting should be neutral or cool studio light, never warm or cinematic.
