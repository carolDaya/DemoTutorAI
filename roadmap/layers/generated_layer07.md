LAYER 7: TEAM TABLES WITH SHIELDS

I'm going to try to generate some artifacts to incorporate into next layer (attached image). These correspond to the next station you should create:

1. Generate a 2.5D isometric digital illustration of exactly 17 round wooden team tables arranged symmetrically over a clear, flat grass surface. Each table must display a distinct heraldic emblem or shield icon on its top surface — use high-contrast, easily readable color schemes such as red, blue, gold, and silver. Emblems should be easily distinguishable and evenly distributed across the composition.

From above, render 17 bright vertical light beams descending onto each table. These beams must be noticeably more luminous than the surroundings, rendered as soft, glowing columns in blue-green tones (#92D6F0 to #B5E8FF). Enhance their visibility with gentle glow bloom or aura effects, ensuring that they appear as magical or divine spotlights without becoming harsh lasers. Avoid neon or sci-fi tones — focus on a mystical, ethereal quality. Use subtle inner gradients and a semi-transparent core to make each light beam look volumetric and softly radiant.

Surround the area with at least 6 tall stone monoliths or obelisks placed near the outer edges of the platform. These should appear visually prominent, evenly spaced, and stylized with embedded symbols or carvings to suggest their function in summoning or focusing the light beams. Render each monolith with a slightly cooler gray or ivory stone texture, matte finish, and isometric shading. Do not cover them with vegetation or clutter.

Make sure to keep in mind:
- Each artifact must be generated separately, as an individual asset with a transparent background (transparent_background: true) to facilitate later compositing in an external editor.
- Paths are delimited with black color and inside that area you must fill with sand color.
- Render all path segments explicitly. In the reference sketch, there are two black-outlined walking paths on the right side of the Crystal Palace. These black outlines represent the exact shape and placement of the roads. You must render both of them, exactly as defined. Do not ignore, skip, or simplify any. Each of these paths must be completely filled with solid color #DAC16E, and the fill must reach edge-to-edge between the black lines, forming a smooth, matte surface with no gradients or texture. The final render must not include the black lines—use them only to define the road's shape. These paths are not optional or decorative—they are required structural elements that must appear precisely in the final image.
- Do not use caricature, cartoon or neon style.

Text-free:
Ignore any visible text in the reference image. You should not include words or labels such as 'QUINIANO' or 'MAGNUS' in the final rendering.

For colors:
Semi-realistic, full-body digital illustration with a clean, neutral white background and soft studio lighting. The character's skin tone is natural and balanced, with no warm or yellow filters. All white clothing should appear pure white (pure RGB white or ivory), with no sepia, beige, or yellow undertones. Avoid cinematic or vintage color grading. Do not apply soft glow, bloom, sunset, sepia, amber, or golden hour lighting. Use neutral or cool light, with realistic shadows in soft gray or blue-gray. The overall palette should be modern and color-accurate: natural-toned skin (light to medium), hair in matte platinum, light brown, or blackish blue, fabric in off-white or cream with accents in dark red, petrol blue, or matte gold. Absolutely no overlays of warm tints. The image should look professionally color balanced, like a clean editorial or medical illustration, without Instagram-style filters. Avoid warm or yellow filters. Do not apply golden hour, amber, sepia, or vintage color grading. Skin tones must appear natural and neutral, not orange or overly warm. White clothing must appear as true white or bone white without yellow, beige, or cream tint. Lighting should be neutral or cool studio light, never warm or cinematic.
