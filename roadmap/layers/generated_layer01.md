LAYER 1: BACKGROUND LANDSCAPE

Here is the initial landscape image you need to create.

- 2.5D isometric style in high fidelity, with a 16:9 aspect ratio (1920x1080).
- The river must run exactly through the vertical center of the canvas, from top to bottom. Don't skew it left or right; that would be a mistake. Below that same river, the flow expands to six times its size, and at the top, there is a small portion of land that you need to draw.
- In the upper right corner of the image, there is another body of water that you need to draw, respecting proportionality. This represents the sea; compared to the river, it is a slightly different color. It should NOT blend with the riverbed.
- The shape of the river and the beach should be organic but contained.
- The bridge must be located right in the center of the image you create and must be a fortified stone bridge with a sturdy structure and proportional to the size of the image.
- Inspired by medieval fantasy picture books.
- Do not use a cartoonish, neon, or caricature style.
- Visual inspiration: Game Map Generator, Settlers, Age of Empires II HD.
- Do not add paths where there aren't any. There are simply some bodies of water and a bridge that crosses from one side to the other, but without any paths; don't make them up.
- Do not add trees because there aren't any in the image I'm sending you.
- Ignore any text visible in the reference image. Do not include words or labels like 'LEFT SIDE' or 'RIGHT SIDE' in the final generation.

For the colors:
Use a color palette inspired by classic video game maps like Settlers or Game Map Generator, characterized by bright, vivid, but not fluorescent tones. Grass should be rendered in saturated, uniform greens, such as lime green and light moss, with a smooth texture that gives the impression of a well-manicured lawn. Trees should have rounded canopies in medium and dark green tones, such as forest green, and trunks in a dark earth brown. Paths are laid out in light beige or pale earth, slightly sunken and with a smooth texture, without stones or abrupt edges. River water should be a deep sky blue with diffused white edges that suggest movement, blending smoothly with the unbroken earth. Rocks or mountains should be light gray with white accents and green patches that simulate moss. Buildings use light or off-white stone walls with bright red or deep blue roofs and dark wood frames, with natural shadows that project volume and depth. The overall lighting is natural and diffused, without warm filters, sunset effects, or artificial glare; shadows should be soft and blue-gray, creating a clean, tidy, and welcoming atmosphere, typical of a medieval strategic fantasy.
