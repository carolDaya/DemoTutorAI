LAYER 4: DOOR THRESHOLD AND STAIRS

I'm going to try to generate some artifacts to incorporate into next layer (attached image). These correspond to the next station you should create:

1. A 2.5D isometric digital illustration of a symbolic arched gateway or threshold, rendered as a freestanding stone structure with medieval-fantasy architecture. The arch is made of pale, lightly textured stone blocks with soft shading and rounded edges. Behind and beneath the arch, render a glowing blue mist or magical fog effect that fills the inside of the archway without leaking outside. The mist should have a subtle, ethereal glow, like a magical scanning or transition portal. It must not look like fire, neon, or high-saturation sci-fi energy. Keep the glow soft and diffuse, with blue tones in the range of #92D6F0 to #B5E8FF. No cartoon outlines. Use soft isometric shadows. Do not include any characters, terrain, steps, text, or other elements—just the standalone arched threshold with transparent background (transparent_background: true). Style: semi-realistic, editorial quality. Consistent with strategy map aesthetics like Game Map Generator, Settlers, or Age of Empires II HD. Lighting: neutral or cool studio lighting. Avoid warm tints, cinematic color grading, or sunset effects. Color discipline: no oversaturation, no warm filters. Clean, balanced palette with cool highlights and matte textures.
2. Just beyond the threshold, render a staircase with exactly eight distinct steps ascending upwards. These stairs represent the eight stages of the training process that applicants must complete. Each step should be slightly higher than the previous one, forming a gentle upward curve or slope in the isometric perspective. The stairs must start directly behind the arched gateway, aligned with the same pathway direction, and continue smoothly without breaks. Each step must be clearly separated and countable. Avoid blending the stairs into the terrain or rendering them abstractly. Do not include any ground, grass, vegetation, or environmental background. The steps must be solid, with a stone or matte surface texture, matching the semi-medieval fantasy aesthetic. Shadows must be soft and isometric. Render the stairs as a standalone asset with a transparent background, so it can be layered behind the gateway artifact.
3. Render all path segments as clearly defined roads. Each path is delimited by two black lines as shown in the reference sketch. These black borders mark the exact shape of the walking paths and must be filled entirely with the color #DAC16E. All path elements must follow the black line boundaries shown in the reference sketch. These lines mark the exact shape of the paths and must be filled entirely and uniformly with the sand color #DAC16E. Do not include the black lines in the final render. Fill must be smooth and flat. Avoid gradients, texture, noise, or darkened edges. The result must look like a clean, uninterrupted surface, consistent with the path design in previous layers. Render each walking path as a standalone isometric asset with a transparent background. Paths must strictly follow the contours defined in the reference sketch — the two black lines drawn in the sketch represent the exact outer boundaries of each path. Do not interpret them as part of the design or decoration.

Make sure to keep in mind:
- Each artifact must be generated separately, as an individual asset with a transparent background (transparent_background: true) to facilitate later compositing in an external editor.
- Paths are delimited with black color and inside that area you must fill with sand color.
- All path elements must be smooth, slightly rounded edges and a flat matte texture. Avoid adding gradients, noise, or lighting effects that alter this tone. This path color must be identical to previous layers for seamless integration.
- Do not use caricature, cartoon or neon style.
- Visual inspiration: Game Map Generator, Settlers, Age of Empires II HD.

Text-free:
Ignore any visible text in the reference image. You should not include words or labels such as 'QUINIANO' or 'MAGNUS' in the final rendering.

For colors:
Semi-realistic, full-body digital illustration with a clean, neutral white background and soft studio lighting. The character's skin tone is natural and balanced, with no warm or yellow filters. All white clothing should appear pure white (pure RGB white or ivory), with no sepia, beige, or yellow undertones. Avoid cinematic or vintage color grading. Do not apply soft glow, bloom, sunset, sepia, amber, or golden hour lighting. Use neutral or cool light, with realistic shadows in soft gray or blue-gray. The overall palette should be modern and color-accurate: natural-toned skin (light to medium), hair in matte platinum, light brown, or blackish blue, fabric in off-white or cream with accents in dark red, petrol blue, or matte gold. Absolutely no overlays of warm tints. The image should look professionally color balanced, like a clean editorial or medical illustration, without Instagram-style filters. Avoid warm or yellow filters. Do not apply golden hour, amber, sepia, or vintage color grading. Skin tones must appear natural and neutral, not orange or overly warm. White clothing must appear as true white or bone white without yellow, beige, or cream tint. Lighting should be neutral or cool studio light, never warm or cinematic.
