LAYER 12: ADA LOVELACE

I'm going to try to generate some artifacts to incorporate into next layer (attached image). These correspond to the next station you should create:

1. Generate a 2.5D isometric digital illustration of a semi-transparent blue-hued holographic character representing Ada Lovelace, styled to visually match the avatars of Quiliano and Magnus from the attached project. The character must be rendered from a front-facing isometric perspective, standing inside a shallow, round platform of glowing water (light cyan-blue #92D6F0 to #B5E8FF), surrounded by a soft energy outline.

Ada should be wearing a simplified fantasy-Victorian dress with short puffed sleeves, elegant detailing, and gloves, echoing the style and silhouette from the provided reference photo, but adapted into a clear, semi-realistic fantasy style consistent with a medieval-tech strategy game. Her hair should retain its recognizable curly side-parted volume and be styled neatly, with a small headband. Keep colors in grayscale or subtle blue-tinted monochrome tones to maintain consistency with the existing avatars. Avoid saturated or modern colors.

Her expression must be gentle and inviting — she should be smiling slightly and extending one hand forward in a welcoming gesture, as if inviting participants into the arena ahead. Her other arm should be relaxed or slightly lifted, adding natural dynamism.

Ship Design:
The ship must have a semi-rounded bow, wooden hull, and minimal ornamentation. Render 2–3 cabin windows, a raised deck area, and one or two sails that appear tied or partially folded (not deployed). The sail fabric should be in neutral or weathered tones (beige, ivory, or light gray) with no modern materials. Wood texture must be matte and slightly weathered — no gloss or shine. Render from a top-down isometric perspective, consistent with the rest of the map.

Style and Integration:
Use soft isometric shadows and neutral lighting. The boat and dock must be presented as a standalone asset with a transparent background, ready to be placed over a pre-rendered ocean. Do not render water, waves, or sea foam. Avoid cartoon outlines or sci-fi elements — keep the aesthetic medieval-fantasy and consistent with structures like stone towers, domes, and paths from previous map layers.

Make sure to keep in mind:
- Each artifact must be generated separately, as an individual asset with a transparent background (transparent_background: true) to facilitate later compositing in an external editor.
- Paths are delimited with black color and inside that area you must fill with sand color.
- Render all path segments explicitly. In the reference sketch, there are two black-outlined walking paths on the right side of the Crystal Palace. These black outlines represent the exact shape and placement of the roads. You must render both of them, exactly as defined. Do not ignore, skip, or simplify any. Each of these paths must be completely filled with solid color #DAC16E, and the fill must reach edge-to-edge between the black lines, forming a smooth, matte surface with no gradients or texture. The final render must not include the black lines—use them only to define the road's shape. These paths are not optional or decorative—they are required structural elements that must appear precisely in the final image.
- Do not use caricature, cartoon or neon style.

Text-free:
Ignore any visible text in the reference image. You should not include words or labels such as 'AI' or 'ADA' in the final rendering.

For colors:
Semi-realistic, full-body digital illustration with a clean, neutral white background and soft studio lighting. The character's skin tone is natural and balanced, with no warm or yellow filters. All white clothing should appear pure white (pure RGB white or ivory), with no sepia, beige, or yellow undertones. Avoid cinematic or vintage color grading. Do not apply soft glow, bloom, sunset, sepia, amber, or golden hour lighting. Use neutral or cool light, with realistic shadows in soft gray or blue-gray. The overall palette should be modern and color-accurate: natural-toned skin (light to medium), hair in matte platinum, light brown, or blackish blue, fabric in off-white or cream with accents in dark red, petrol blue, or matte gold. Absolutely no overlays of warm tints. The image should look professionally color balanced, like a clean editorial or medical illustration, without Instagram-style filters. Avoid warm or yellow filters. Do not apply golden hour, amber, sepia, or vintage color grading. Skin tones must appear natural and neutral, not orange or overly warm. White clothing must appear as true white or bone white without yellow, beige, or cream tint. Lighting should be neutral or cool studio light, never warm or cinematic.
