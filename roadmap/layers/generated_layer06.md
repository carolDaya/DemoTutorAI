LAYER 6: SYNTHETIC DATA LAB

I'm going to try to generate some artifacts to incorporate into next layer (attached image). These correspond to the next station you should create:

1. Generate a 2.5D isometric digital illustration of a secluded Data Laboratory nestled in a rocky, natural setting without rendering any grass, foliage, moss, green terrain, or vegetation textures of any kind. The structure should resemble a fantasy-inspired research facility, blending medieval and tech aesthetics, with white stone walls, a curved glass dome, signal-receiving antennae, and obelisks or crystal monoliths with embedded data panels.

From the dome or a spire, render a cascade of data—a vertical stream of glowing runes, blue glyphs, or soft digital light resembling a waterfall. This "datafall" must glow gently in blue hues between #92D6F0 and #B5E8FF, symbolizing transformation of knowledge into usable synthetic data.

Do not render any grass, trees, bushes, or green landscape elements. The terrain must look like neutral-toned rocky ground or clean empty base with no environmental decoration. Focus only on the building, the data cascade, and the path.

Render a clearly defined walking path, delimited by black lines and filled entirely and uniformly with the sand color #DAC16E. The path must be flat, clean, and free of any gradients, textures, dirt, shading, outlines, or darkened borders. Use only the flat fill color inside the black contours. The black lines must be used to define the path’s exact shape but must not appear in the final output.


Make sure to keep in mind:
- Each artifact must be generated separately, as an individual asset with a transparent background (transparent_background: true) to facilitate later compositing in an external editor.
- Paths are delimited with black color and inside that area you must fill with sand color.
- Render all path segments explicitly. In the reference sketch, there are two black-outlined walking paths on the right side of the Crystal Palace. These black outlines represent the exact shape and placement of the roads. You must render both of them, exactly as defined. Do not ignore, skip, or simplify any. Each of these paths must be completely filled with solid color #DAC16E, and the fill must reach edge-to-edge between the black lines, forming a smooth, matte surface with no gradients or texture. The final render must not include the black lines—use them only to define the road's shape. These paths are not optional or decorative—they are required structural elements that must appear precisely in the final image.
- Do not use caricature, cartoon or neon style.
- Visual inspiration: Game Map Generator, Settlers, Age of Empires II HD.

Text-free:
Ignore any visible text in the reference image. You should not include words or labels such as 'QUINIANO' or 'MAGNUS' in the final rendering.

For colors:
Semi-realistic, full-body digital illustration with a clean, neutral white background and soft studio lighting. The character's skin tone is natural and balanced, with no warm or yellow filters. All white clothing should appear pure white (pure RGB white or ivory), with no sepia, beige, or yellow undertones. Avoid cinematic or vintage color grading. Do not apply soft glow, bloom, sunset, sepia, amber, or golden hour lighting. Use neutral or cool light, with realistic shadows in soft gray or blue-gray. The overall palette should be modern and color-accurate: natural-toned skin (light to medium), hair in matte platinum, light brown, or blackish blue, fabric in off-white or cream with accents in dark red, petrol blue, or matte gold. Absolutely no overlays of warm tints. The image should look professionally color balanced, like a clean editorial or medical illustration, without Instagram-style filters. Avoid warm or yellow filters. Do not apply golden hour, amber, sepia, or vintage color grading. Skin tones must appear natural and neutral, not orange or overly warm. White clothing must appear as true white or bone white without yellow, beige, or cream tint. Lighting should be neutral or cool studio light, never warm or cinematic.
