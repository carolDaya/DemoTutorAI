LAYER 16: AERIAL CABLE

I'm going to try to generate some artifacts to incorporate into next layer (attached image). These correspond to the next station you should create:

1. I'm going to try to generate some artifacts to incorporate into the next map layer (reference images attached). These correspond to the aerial cable car system that transports participants across the terrain. All elements must be rendered separately with transparent backgrounds and styled in full harmony with the semi-realistic, vibrant medieval-tech aesthetic seen throughout this map (Settlers, Age of Empires II HD, Game Map Generator).

Assets to generate:

Embarkation Station
Design a small isometric boarding station where participants enter the cable car system. Unlike rustic medieval huts, this structure should blend fantasy and light technology—built from matte stone and wood with modern flourishes like steel trusses or smooth slate roofs, echoing the tone of the Crystal Tower and Observatory buildings. The station must include a compact raised platform, a structural canopy for shelter, and a support post where the cables begin. Use clean geometric design and soft metallic accents in neutral grays or pale blues. The terrain base should be rendered in smooth stone tiles (#DAC16E) for seamless integration into the game map.

Disembarkation Station
This should be a mirrored design of the embarkation station but placed on elevated terrain. Add a higher rear platform, subtle stone stairs, and a visible pulley system in matte iron or bronze near the top edge. Ensure visual consistency with the embarkation station, with slight asymmetries or vertical elements to clearly signal this is an arrival zone. Use similar modern-fantasy tech design, but with elevation-based cues.

Cable Car Cabins (x3)
Create three individual 2.5D isometric cable car cabins, each suspended as if mid-ride with a small portion of cable attached above. The cabins must be colored in vivid, cheerful tones of the Colombian flag:

Bright yellow (#FFD447)

Bold blue (#3B77E4)

Rich red (#E2453C)
Each cabin must follow a soft-edged, fantasy-tech design — slightly futuristic but grounded — with simplified support arms, gently curved window panels (tinted but not transparent), and matte-finished panels. Avoid glassy or modern realism. These cabins must be consistent in size with previous game structures and feel playful yet technologically appropriate.

Style & Integration Notes
Use isometric perspective, matte textures, no gloss or bloom. Lighting must be neutral-cool, with soft shadows and no sci-fi or ultra-modern elements. All assets must be delivered separately with transparent background to allow compositing on top of the existing narrative terrain.

The assets must be visually consistent with previous structures such as the Crystal Tower, forest geometry, and lake-based avatars. Emphasize a balance of charm, functionality, and symbolic clarity: this system is meant to transport participants with efficiency and magic through the AI competition world.

Color and Lighting Guidelines
Do not apply cinematic filters, sepia, glow, or golden hour lighting. Use editorial, neutral light sources, balanced white and gray shadows, and professionally rendered hues. Avoid warm or yellow filters. The palette must remain semi-realistic with touches of fantasy charm. All white should appear pure white or ivory (not beige), and all color tones must be clean and color-accurate.

For colors:
Semi-realistic, full-body digital illustration with a clean, neutral white background and soft studio lighting. The character's skin tone is natural and balanced, with no warm or yellow filters. All white clothing should appear pure white (pure RGB white or ivory), with no sepia, beige, or yellow undertones. Avoid cinematic or vintage color grading. Do not apply soft glow, bloom, sunset, sepia, amber, or golden hour lighting. Use neutral or cool light, with realistic shadows in soft gray or blue-gray. The overall palette should be modern and color-accurate: natural-toned skin (light to medium), hair in matte platinum, light brown, or blackish blue, fabric in off-white or cream with accents in dark red, petrol blue, or matte gold. Absolutely no overlays of warm tints. The image should look professionally color balanced, like a clean editorial or medical illustration, without Instagram-style filters. Avoid warm or yellow filters. Do not apply golden hour, amber, sepia, or vintage color grading. Skin tones must appear natural and neutral, not orange or overly warm. White clothing must appear as true white or bone white without yellow, beige, or cream tint. Lighting should be neutral or cool studio light, never warm or cinematic.
