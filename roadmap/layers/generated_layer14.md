LAYER 14: STAGE, SCREEN AND JURIES CHAIRS

I'm going to try to generate some artifacts to incorporate into next layer (attached image). These correspond to the next station you should create:

1. Generate a 2.5D isometric digital illustration of an outdoor fantasy-tech presentation stage for a medieval strategy game map. This stage will serve as the final presentation area where competition teams pitch their MVPs. The composition must be styled consistently with the rest of the map (Settlers, Age of Empires II HD, Game Map Generator): semi-realistic, matte textures, clean editorial lighting, and a soft isometric perspective. Transparent background.

Stage Design
The structure is a slightly elevated concert-style stage or open-air platform. It includes large standing speakers on either side (rectangular, matte dark wood or metal casing, with visible round white drivers) and a roof-like frame made of metal scaffolding trusses. Across the top of the structure, integrate a stadium-style digital screen — this screen must display a large rendering of the avatar of Eleanor Roosevelt (to be composited externally), captured mid-speech. The screen should include two prominent elements:

The Globant logo (to be composited externally)

The bold label “AI Pods” in large modern typography

The screen must be large relative to the stage, proportionally similar to a real stadium concert setup.

Lighting and Details
Render 3–5 overhead stage spotlights above the platform, mounted on the scaffolding and angled downward. Use soft shadows and neutral lighting—avoid glow, bloom, or neon effects. The scene must not be theatrical or futuristic—stay within grounded medieval-fantasy tone with semi-modern tech flavor.

Jury Section
In front of the stage, place three empty jury chairs arranged in a gentle arc facing the platform. These chairs should be styled like classic red canvas director's chairs with wooden X-legs. The backs of each chair must read “JURADO” in bold uppercase white letters. No characters or people should be seated. Shadows must be soft and proportional.

Text & Compositing Note
Ignore any embedded text in reference images — the Globant logo, “AI Pods” text, and avatar of Eleanor Roosevelt will be composited separately into the screen area. Please leave this screen surface blank, rendered in dark blue-gray or metallic tones with a subtle inner glow or glassy finish to facilitate overlay.

Visual consistency references: Eleanor avatar, Quiliano, Magnus, Ada, paths (#DAC16E), arena and tower structures, forest asset geometry, and overall visual language of Settlers/strategy map systems.

Trophy: Generate a 2.5D isometric digital illustration of a golden champion’s trophy, designed in harmony with the visual style of a medieval-fantasy strategy map like Settlers, Age of Empires II HD, or Game Map Generator. The trophy should have a classic cup shape with two side handles, a tall central stem, and a sturdy base. While the form is inspired by traditional competition trophies, the rendering must adapt to a semi-realistic, grounded fantasy aesthetic—using matte textures, soft isometric shadows, and no glossy or overly modern effects.

The cup should be colored in warm matte gold tones (ranging from #D6A84F to #F5C56A), with soft, natural highlights that convey richness without artificial shine. The base should appear as carved wood or matte stone in warm browns or neutral grays, featuring a subtle engraved “1” or a small metallic emblem to suggest it is awarded to first place. Its proportions must be consistent with other small symbolic assets in the map, like scrolls, statues, or podiums.

The illustration must have a transparent background and be rendered with clean, neutral lighting—no glow, bloom, sepia, or cinematic grading. The object must feel slightly aged but well-kept, as if it belonged to a long tradition of champions. No characters or surrounding scenery should be included—just the trophy itself, ready to be placed as a final decorative reward in the map’s narrative.

For colors:
Semi-realistic, full-body digital illustration with a clean, neutral white background and soft studio lighting. The character's skin tone is natural and balanced, with no warm or yellow filters. All white clothing should appear pure white (pure RGB white or ivory), with no sepia, beige, or yellow undertones. Avoid cinematic or vintage color grading. Do not apply soft glow, bloom, sunset, sepia, amber, or golden hour lighting. Use neutral or cool light, with realistic shadows in soft gray or blue-gray. The overall palette should be modern and color-accurate: natural-toned skin (light to medium), hair in matte platinum, light brown, or blackish blue, fabric in off-white or cream with accents in dark red, petrol blue, or matte gold. Absolutely no overlays of warm tints. The image should look professionally color balanced, like a clean editorial or medical illustration, without Instagram-style filters. Avoid warm or yellow filters. Do not apply golden hour, amber, sepia, or vintage color grading. Skin tones must appear natural and neutral, not orange or overly warm. White clothing must appear as true white or bone white without yellow, beige, or cream tint. Lighting should be neutral or cool studio light, never warm or cinematic.
