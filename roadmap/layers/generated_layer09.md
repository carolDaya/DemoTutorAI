LAYER 9: CONVERGENT ARENA

I'm going to try to generate some artifacts to incorporate into next layer (attached image). These correspond to the next station you should create:

1. Generate a 2.5D isometric digital illustration of The Convergent Arena, a structured, elevated competition site located atop a rocky plateau. This fantasy-tech arena marks the final stage of the journey, featuring a symmetrical open-air coliseum surrounded by 6–8 tall crystalline columns. These columns glow softly in magical blue hues (#92D6F0 to #B5E8FF) and emit vertical beams of light skyward, forming the anchors of a semi-transparent dome of ethereal energy that encases the arena. The dome must appear magical and protective, gently glowing and volumetric—not sci-fi or laser-like.

At the arena’s center rises a sleek vertical spire representing the AI intelligence guiding the challenge—a fusion of a mystical tower and data node, softly glowing at its peak. The floor is paved in stone or smooth tiles with faint geometric patterns; avoid grass or decorative clutter. A flat path made of solid #DAC16E leads from the Garden of Bonding into the arena, matching previous map paths in texture and tone.

Render everything in a semi-realistic, fantasy-medieval strategy map style (like Settlers or Age of Empires II HD), with matte textures, neutral lighting, and clean editorial-quality detail. No characters or text, no exaggerated fantasy or sci-fi elements. Transparent background required for compositing.

Make sure to keep in mind:
- Each artifact must be generated separately, as an individual asset with a transparent background (transparent_background: true) to facilitate later compositing in an external editor.
- Paths are delimited with black color and inside that area you must fill with sand color.
- Render all path segments explicitly. In the reference sketch, there are two black-outlined walking paths on the right side of the Crystal Palace. These black outlines represent the exact shape and placement of the roads. You must render both of them, exactly as defined. Do not ignore, skip, or simplify any. Each of these paths must be completely filled with solid color #DAC16E, and the fill must reach edge-to-edge between the black lines, forming a smooth, matte surface with no gradients or texture. The final render must not include the black lines—use them only to define the road's shape. These paths are not optional or decorative—they are required structural elements that must appear precisely in the final image.
- Do not use caricature, cartoon or neon style.
- Visual inspiration: Game Map Generator, Settlers, Age of Empires II HD.

Text-free:
Ignore any visible text in the reference image. You should not include words or labels such as 'AI' or 'ADA' in the final rendering.

For colors:
Semi-realistic, full-body digital illustration with a clean, neutral white background and soft studio lighting. The character's skin tone is natural and balanced, with no warm or yellow filters. All white clothing should appear pure white (pure RGB white or ivory), with no sepia, beige, or yellow undertones. Avoid cinematic or vintage color grading. Do not apply soft glow, bloom, sunset, sepia, amber, or golden hour lighting. Use neutral or cool light, with realistic shadows in soft gray or blue-gray. The overall palette should be modern and color-accurate: natural-toned skin (light to medium), hair in matte platinum, light brown, or blackish blue, fabric in off-white or cream with accents in dark red, petrol blue, or matte gold. Absolutely no overlays of warm tints. The image should look professionally color balanced, like a clean editorial or medical illustration, without Instagram-style filters. Avoid warm or yellow filters. Do not apply golden hour, amber, sepia, or vintage color grading. Skin tones must appear natural and neutral, not orange or overly warm. White clothing must appear as true white or bone white without yellow, beige, or cream tint. Lighting should be neutral or cool studio light, never warm or cinematic.
