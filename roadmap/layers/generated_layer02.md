LAYER 2: OBSERVATORY AND STAGE

I'm going to try to generate some artifacts to incorporate into layer 1 (attached image). These correspond to the first two stations you should create:

1. Technological Observatory (the strategy is presented): an observatory with a telescopic sight to the sky, resembling a place where the creators of this year's challenge sit and deliberate. It should be in a 2.5D isometric style, with illustrated fantasy semi-medieval architecture, white or light stone walls, and deep red roofs. The dome has a large telescope jutting into the sky, with volume, soft shading, and a metallic texture. The design is robust but harmonious, without exaggerated futuristic details, with an arched doorway and small windows. The palette is vibrant but not saturated, similar to Settlers or Game Map Generator. Not cartoonish or photorealistic, but clear editorial illustration, consistent with fantasy strategy maps.

2. The path from point 1 leads to a platform where the kickoff will take place and which has a megaphone. The invited training centers are represented around it. People are gathered, listening to what the presenter says from the platform and the megaphone. The speaker character must have a clearly defined face with realistic human proportions. Avoid stylized, cartoonish, or distorted facial features. The face should include anatomically correct eyes, nose, mouth, and expression. Use soft shadowing and realistic detailing to convey personality and presence. No exaggerations or simplifications in facial anatomy. Create a semi-realistic isometric character of a young adult male (age 20â€“30) standing on a platform in a presenting posture. The character should wear a fantasy-inspired tunic (bone white with deep red and matte gold accents), with arms slightly raised in oratory gesture, with one arm slightly raised and the other relaxed or resting, as in a confident presenter or educator, not in a preaching or religious posture. The face must be anatomically correct, realistic, and expressive, with confident features and proportional structure. Hair should be platinum blond, brown, or dark blue-black, with natural texture. Skin tone must be light to medium, without yellow or orange tint. Use neutral or cool lighting. No cartoon features, no yellow filters, no fantasy glow.


Make sure to keep in mind:
- Each artifact must be generated separately, as an individual asset with a transparent background (transparent_background: true) to facilitate later compositing in an external editor.
- The observatory will have a large, futuristic telescope. An entrance door and a window, as seen in the figure.
- From the observatory, a path will lead to a platform from which a presenter is loudly announcing something. In the center of the platform, a Colombian flag and megaphones will be raised to amplify the information.
- Render exactly 12 campfires arranged in a visible circular or semicircular pattern around the platform. Each campfire must have between 2 and 4 young adult people sitting around it, without exception. The campfires must be easily countable and not overlapped or hidden. The total number of people must be 100, distributed realistically across the campfires.
- Characters must be young adults between 18 and 28 years old, with normal human proportions, without childish or exaggerated features. Avoid large heads or small bodies. Use standard anatomical proportions, not a cartoonish style.
- Ensure there are at least 100 people represented in the scene. This can be achieved by densely grouping them around campfires or standing areas near the platform. Don't draw them scattered.
- Apply the same visual style as the previously generated observatory: 2.5D isometric, semi-realistic, accurate colors without excessive saturation, normal human proportions, and structures and characters consistent with the aesthetics of strategic maps such as Settlers or Age of Empires HD. Use natural lighting and avoid cartoonish, neon, photorealistic, or warm-filtered styles.
- Do not generate any water elements. Avoid rivers, lakes, streams, or pools. No water should be present in the scene.
- Do not use caricature, cartoon or neon style.
- Visual inspiration: Game Map Generator, Settlers, Age of Empires II HD.

Text-free:
Ignore any visible text in the reference image. You should not include words or labels such as 'OBSERVATORY' or 'COLOMBIAN FLAG' in the final rendering.

For colors:
Semi-realistic, full-body digital illustration with a clean, neutral white background and soft studio lighting. The character's skin tone is natural and balanced, with no warm or yellow filters. All white clothing should appear pure white (pure RGB white or ivory), with no sepia, beige, or yellow undertones. Avoid cinematic or vintage color grading. Do not apply soft glow, bloom, sunset, sepia, amber, or golden hour lighting. Use neutral or cool light, with realistic shadows in soft gray or blue-gray. The overall palette should be modern and color-accurate: natural-toned skin (light to medium), hair in matte platinum, light brown, or blackish blue, fabric in off-white or cream with accents in dark red, petrol blue, or matte gold. Absolutely no overlays of warm tints. The image should look professionally color balanced, like a clean editorial or medical illustration, without Instagram-style filters. Avoid warm or yellow filters. Do not apply golden hour, amber, sepia, or vintage color grading. Skin tones must appear natural and neutral, not orange or overly warm. White clothing must appear as true white or bone white without yellow, beige, or cream tint. Lighting should be neutral or cool studio light, never warm or cinematic.
