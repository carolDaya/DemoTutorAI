LAYER 3: LAKES

I'm going to try to generate some artifacts to incorporate into next layer (attached image). These correspond to the stations three and four (two lakes) you should create:

1. There are two reflection lakes. These are circular lakes (although their circular shape isn't perfect) that reflect differently because you will reflect on what lies within you in terms of the project idea you will propose for the competition.
2. The second lake is to measure your technical and teamwork skills. There should be a boat next to the lake, representing the participant entering the lake to have their reflection experience and then continuing onward. This learning is represented by a rolled-up papyrus. I will describe these avatars in more detail in a later section.

AI helpers-avatars
These avatars must be clearly distinguishable figures on the map, as if they were just another participant, but with a distinctive feature—it can be holographic—that indicates they are an AI assisting participants. However, their figure must be humanoid and similar to the character they claim to represent.

- Quiliano (Solutions Developer): Must be in the first reflection pool. He is an AI representation of Quintilian, the Roman senator and rhetorician, who can help shape the project the apprentices will apply for.
- Magnus (Competitor Profiler): Must be in the second reflection pool. He is an AI representation of Alexander the Great, a famous emperor who was known for his excellent identification of talent and for building winning teams that helped him grow his empire. He will determine the technical and soft skills each participant will possess.

Make sure to keep in mind:
- Each artifact must be generated separately, as an individual asset with a transparent background (transparent_background: true) to facilitate later compositing in an external editor.
- Avatars must be semi-realistic isometric characters. The face must be anatomically correct, realistic, and expressive, with confident features and proportional structure. Skin tone must be light to medium, without yellow or orange tint. Use neutral or cool lighting. No cartoon features, no yellow filters, no fantasy glow.
- All path elements must match the color #DAC16E exactly, with smooth, slightly rounded edges and a flat matte texture. Avoid adding gradients, noise, or lighting effects that alter this tone. This path color must be identical to previous layers for seamless integration.
- Do not use caricature, cartoon or neon style.
- Visual inspiration: Game Map Generator, Settlers, Age of Empires II HD.
- I'm giving you attached the avatar of both Quiniano and Magnus so you can recreate their figures in a consistent way in the generated image. 

Text-free:
Ignore any visible text in the reference image. You should not include words or labels such as 'QUINIANO' or 'MAGNUS' in the final rendering.

For colors:
Semi-realistic, full-body digital illustration with a clean, neutral white background and soft studio lighting. The character's skin tone is natural and balanced, with no warm or yellow filters. All white clothing should appear pure white (pure RGB white or ivory), with no sepia, beige, or yellow undertones. Avoid cinematic or vintage color grading. Do not apply soft glow, bloom, sunset, sepia, amber, or golden hour lighting. Use neutral or cool light, with realistic shadows in soft gray or blue-gray. The overall palette should be modern and color-accurate: natural-toned skin (light to medium), hair in matte platinum, light brown, or blackish blue, fabric in off-white or cream with accents in dark red, petrol blue, or matte gold. Absolutely no overlays of warm tints. The image should look professionally color balanced, like a clean editorial or medical illustration, without Instagram-style filters. Avoid warm or yellow filters. Do not apply golden hour, amber, sepia, or vintage color grading. Skin tones must appear natural and neutral, not orange or overly warm. White clothing must appear as true white or bone white without yellow, beige, or cream tint. Lighting should be neutral or cool studio light, never warm or cinematic.
