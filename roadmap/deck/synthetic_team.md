Inside a cinematic, glass-walled tech office softly lit with realistic teal-blue reflections, three young Colombian adults — exactly three — collaborate as a focused, creative team, developing a coding project together. The ambient light is subtle and realistic, with no artificial glare or warm cast, creating soft shadows and photographic depth across the scene. This image should feel clean, natural, editorial — perfect as the hero shot for a hackathon or tech competition promotion.

Seated at a desk in clear side profile is a 20-year-old Colombian man with short black curly hair, warm brown skin, and a slight trimmed beard. He wears a fitted dark crewneck long-sleeve t-shirt with the sleeves casually rolled up at the forearms. His hands rest lightly on a sleek white mechanical keyboard, actively typing or reacting to feedback. His posture is relaxed but attentive. He has a subtle, confident smile — not exaggerated — suggesting he’s engaged and enjoying the challenge.

To his immediate left (viewer’s left) and leaning forward from beside him is a 20-year-old Colombian woman, with medium-light brown skin and long dark hair worn loose. She wears a casual dark shirt and is clearly part of the core collaboration. Her right hand is extended, pointing toward the screen, and her body language is expressive and active. Her face shows focus but with a slight smile, reflecting enthusiasm and camaraderie.

Just behind them, completing the trio, stands another 20-year-old Colombian man from Bogotá, with slightly lighter skin, short dark hair, and no beard. His posture is open and observant — leaning forward a little or with his hand on the desk. He also shows a faint, relaxed smile, watching attentively, clearly involved in the team process.

To the right, a large screen is tilted slightly toward the viewer. It shows a dark-mode code editor with green and cyan highlights, realistic and sharp, indicating they are building a prototype or MVP. Floating in front of the monitor are two AI assistant icons — 3D-style semi-transparent robots with glowing faces, antennae, and small arms, proportionally sized and clearly assisting. They carry interface symbols like gears or user icons and must be stylized but refined — integrated, not cartoonish.

In the left third of the image, there is a soft dark-to-teal gradient fade for potential text placement. From the lower-left corner, a stylized green-turquoise light wave or energy flare arcs upward with elegant contrast and softness. The background remains gently blurred, without text or distraction.

The entire composition is in 16:9 cinematic ratio, designed to feel natural, dynamic, and emotionally resonant — ideal for promotional materials, posters, banners, or digital headers of a youth innovation challenge.
