Half-length portrait of *Ada*, a 25-year-old Victorian-era mathematician and inventor, with fair complexion and a natural rosy undertone (no yellow cast). Her dark-brown hair is styled in soft ringlets gathered back and accented with a thin gold ribbon. She wears an elegant mid-19th-century black silk gown featuring subtle gold embroidery at the neckline and cuffs, along with elbow-length black lace gloves. In her right (gloved) hand she lightly holds a slim brass pencil near her chin, conveying an analytical, thoughtful pose; expression is calm and confident. Style: clean retro-futuristic photography with high-key studio lighting, razor-sharp focus, plain white background. Square (1:1) composition, 4 K resolution, photorealistic, ultra-sharp detail â€” matching the visual aesthetic of the Quiliano, Quintiliano, and Magnus avatars.

Negative prompt: blurry, low-res, watermark, extra limbs, oversaturated skin, modern gadgets, goggles, large machinery, yellowish skin tones.
