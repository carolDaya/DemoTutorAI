Half-length vertical portrait of a 17-year-old Leonardo da Vinci, depicted as a humble and brilliant apprentice in a Florentine artisan workshop around the year 1469. He has a Mediterranean complexion with natural olive-toned skin (no yellow cast), expressive dark eyes, and soft wavy chestnut hair, slightly tousled. His expression is calm, thoughtful, and approachable — reflecting quiet intelligence and curiosity. He wears a simple off-white linen tunic (camisia) with a shallow V-slit neckline, loose sleeves, and no decoration. The tunic is slightly creased and tied at the waist with a thin brown leather cord. No cloak, no outer garment, no brooch, no jewelry. In his right hand, he gently holds a wooden set square — a well-used Renaissance drafting tool. The background is clean and bright white, studio-lit with soft neutral lighting. Photorealistic, ultra-sharp detail, vertical composition (not square), matching the lighting and framing of the Magnus and Quintiliano avatars. No modern objects, no gold, no embroidery, no symbolic crowns or fantasy elements.
