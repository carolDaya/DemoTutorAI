Half-length portrait of *Magnus*, a young strategist modeled on Alexander the Great — early-20s, Mediterranean complexion with natural olive tone (no yellow cast), wavy light-brown hair brushed back, clean-shaven. He wears an immaculate white chiton (tunic) edged with a subtle Greek meander pattern and a deep crimson cloak fastened at the shoulder with a small golden Sun-of-Vergina brooch. A delicate golden laurel crown rests on his head. Expression: serene, confident smile; arms relaxed at his sides. Style: clean retro-futuristic photography with high-key studio lighting, razor-sharp focus, plain white background. Square (1:1) composition, 4 K resolution, photorealistic, ultra-sharp detail — matching the visual aesthetic of the Quiliano and Quintiliano avatars.  

Negative prompt: blurry, low-res, watermark, extra limbs, oversaturated skin, anachronistic weapons or modern gadgets, goggles, armor with excessive detail, yellowish skin tones.
