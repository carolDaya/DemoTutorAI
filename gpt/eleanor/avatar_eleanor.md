Half-length portrait of *Eleanor*, a 22-year-old early-20th-century public-speaking mentor, with fair porcelain complexion and soft hazel eyes. Her light-brown hair is styled in loose, slightly tousled waves pinned back in Edwardian fashion. She wears a sky-blue silk blouse featuring delicate pastel embroidery along the collar and cuffs. Arms relaxed; her right hand is gently raised near her lips in a graceful, expressive gesture as if articulating an idea. Expression: calm, encouraging smile; eyes engaged. Style: clean retro-futuristic photography with high-key studio lighting, razor-sharp focus, plain white background. Square (1 : 1) composition, 4 K resolution, photorealistic, ultra-sharp detail â€” perfectly matching the visual aesthetic of Quiliano, Quintiliano, Magnus and Ada.

Negative prompt: blurry, low-res, watermark, extra limbs, oversaturated skin tones, modern gadgets, large hats, logos, goggles.
