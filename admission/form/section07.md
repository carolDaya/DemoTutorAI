## Carefully read and understand the following text extract (try not to use a translator)

The world as we knew it is dead —what comes next largerly depends on who builds it. Artificial intelligence, digital economies, and algorithmic governance are not distant possibilities— they are already reshaping the way we live, work and think. Every aspect of life, from the information we consume to the relationships we form, is increasingly madiated by machines. We are entering an era where AI will not only assist human decision-making but, in many cases, replace it entirely. This transformation raises fundamental questions: What does it mean to be human when AI mimic our creativity, outthink our brightest minds, and potentially alter our social and economic structures? How do we find meaning in a world where our labor, art, and even relationships risk becoming obsolete? These are not merely technological challenges; they are spiritual crises dressed in silicon.

Our fight is not simply for control over data, algorithms, or economic power —it is a battle to reclaim reality itself. We are witnessing the systematic erosion of objective truth, as AI-generated narratives, synthetic media, and machine-driven consensus distort our perception of the world. Reality, once anchored in divine order and natural law, is now subject to manipulation by those who control the algorithms. This is not just a technological development; it is the final consequence of a civilization that has abandoned truth in favor of power.
