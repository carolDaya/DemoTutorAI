# Bitácora Sintética - Opening Theme

**Descripción en inglés para Suno o IA musical:**

Create a 30-second instrumental opening theme for a technology and education podcast called *Bitácora Sintética*. The music should be energetic, inspiring, and futuristic, with a clear sense of momentum, reflecting themes of artificial intelligence, innovation, and collaborative learning. Use clean electronic tones, light percussion, and subtle synth layers to give it a modern, tech-driven feel, while keeping it friendly and approachable for a wide audience. No vocals, purely instrumental.  
Ensure it fades out naturally at the end to transition smoothly into speech.
