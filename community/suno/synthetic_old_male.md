Create a square (1:1) WhatsApp profile picture, split cleanly and perfectly down the vertical center into two symmetrical halves.

Left side – robot agent:
A friendly robot in the visual style of the SENA Soft agents: glowing cyan visor with two eyes and a soft smile, square-rounded head, capsule torso, and two antenna spheres.
The robot’s head must be identical in size and scale to the human head on the right — same width (cheek to cheek) and same height (crown to chin).
Place the robot face so that its features (eyes and mouth) align perfectly on the same horizontal lines as the human’s. Ensure the robot is not smaller or lower in the frame than the human side. Use light turquoise for the shell (#27D9F0), with darker shadows (#1B90A8), and a subtle cyan glow.

Right side – human (instructor):
A 40-year-old male SENA technology instructor, with very fair (almost Anglo-Saxon) skin, short dark brown hair graying slightly at the temples, and clean-shaven.
He wears dark-rimmed eyeglasses and a charcoal-gray crew neck shirt (#2F2F2F). His expression should be confident and warm, with a subtle smile.
Only half of his face should be shown — one eye, half a nose, half a mouth — cut exactly at the vertical midpoint of the face.

Facial alignment (critical):

The face split must go exactly through the middle of both robot and human heads.

The robot's head must not be smaller than the human's.

Robot and human heads should be the same height and centered at the same vertical position.

Eyes and mouth should align perfectly across both halves.

Lighting and background:
Cinematic teal-blue lighting, dark petrol blue-green background (#013B4E) with soft glass reflections. Include a glowing cyan arc sweeping up from the lower left. Use subtle rim lighting and a shallow depth of field.

Style keywords for generation:
--ar 1:1 --v 5 --style raw --quality 2 photorealistic, cinematic teal lighting, perfect symmetry, matching head scale, confident male instructor, friendly AI agent, SENA Soft style, glowing cyan, half-face split

Negative prompt:
robot head smaller than human, mismatched alignment, cartoon style, full nose or both eyes visible, yellowish skin, asymmetry, beard, harsh shadows, text overlay, robot shifted downward
