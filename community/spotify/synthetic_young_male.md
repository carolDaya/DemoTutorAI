Create a square (1:1) WhatsApp profile picture, split exactly down the vertical center into two symmetrical halves. The left side should depict a friendly teal-cyan robot in the same soft, rounded style as the floating agents from the SENA Soft competition. It should have a square-rounded head, glowing cyan visor with two eyes and a soft smile, antenna spheres, and a capsule-shaped body. Use a light turquoise satin finish (#27D9F0) with shadows (#1B90A8) and subtle inner cyan glow. The robot’s expression should be cheerful and calm.

The right side should be a photorealistic human face with androgynous features — warm brown skin tone (#6E4734), short to medium dark brown hair brushed back, no beard or makeup, and a small silver stud earring in the visible ear. The person should wear a charcoal-gray crew neck shirt (#2F2F2F). Their expression should show a subtle, confident smile with a hint of emotion — curiosity or inspiration — matching the robot’s warmth.

IMPORTANT: The size and proportion of the human head must match the robot head exactly. Align the crown, chin, and cheeks so that both halves mirror each other. Align eyes and mouth across the divide on the same horizontal lines.

Use cinematic teal-blue lighting and ambiance like a modern tech office. The background should be deep petrol blue-green (#013B4E), softly blurred, with faint glass reflections. Add a glowing neon cyan arc rising from the bottom left corner, echoing the curved lighting effect seen in SENA Soft visuals.

Ensure high resolution and mid-to-high contrast, with shallow depth of field. Both halves must be equally detailed and balanced — no exaggerated features, no mismatch in size or visual weight.
