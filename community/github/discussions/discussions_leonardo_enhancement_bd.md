# Prompt - Banner post-it para discusi√≥n de Leonardo (4:1)

A 2D digital illustration on a light blue, slightly textured sticky note background,
featuring Leonardo from the provided avatar image, depicted in a friendly cartoon style
with black outlines and warm beige shading.

Leonardo is shown pointing toward a simple cylindrical database icon,
symbolizing an external data source, with a small check mark overlay indicating readiness or validation. 

An arrow connects Leonardo to the database.

On the left side of the banner, inside the sticky note, include the text:

"LEONARDO" in uppercase bold hand-drawn font, and below it in a smaller size: "Now with enhanced Q&A capabilities!".

The style should feel casual, as if doodled with pen and marker, with imperfect lines and a brainstorming aesthetic.

Format: wide banner, aspect ratio 4:1, optimized for GitHub Discussions.
