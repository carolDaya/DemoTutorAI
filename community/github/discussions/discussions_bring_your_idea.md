# GitHub - Banner estilo post-it para Discussions

A 2D digital illustration on a textured, yellow sticky note background, featuring the synthetic team of three people from the provided image working together at a desk, integrated with the avatars of Ada and Alan from the provided images

The style is hand-drawn, sketch-like, as if doodled in pen and marker, with soft shadows and a casual, brainstorming aesthetic

The composition should be horizontal, leaving space for text on the left, and evoke a sense of creativity, collaboration, and idea sharing

The sticky note background should be slightly rough with paper texture, and the drawing should have imperfect, friendly lines to resemble a quick concept sketch.

Format: wide banner, aspect ratio 4:1, optimized for GitHub Discussions.
